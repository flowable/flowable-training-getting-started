Follow this guide carefully, step by step, to ensure a smooth setup. No jumping ahead! üòâ

----

1. **License File**  
   Copy the provided `flowable.license` file to a folder named `.flowable` in your home directory (e.g., `~/.flowable/`).

2. **Prerequisites**
   - **Java SDK:** Java 17 or newer is required for this setup.
   - **Maven Settings:** Copy the provided `settings.xml` into your `~/.m2/` directory. Example: `C:\Users\YourName\.m2\settings.xml` or `~/.m2/settings.xml` on Unix systems.  
     _If you don‚Äôt want to overwrite your current file, see the [Custom settings.xml](#custom-settingsxml) section below._

3. **Build the Project**
   Sync/Reload your Maven project in your IDE (e.g., in IntelliJ, open the "Maven" panel and click the following icon):
   ![Reload](./documentation/reload.png)<br/>
   This should usually happen automatically.

## Starting the Applications

- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate:** Use the provided Spring Boot configurations.  
  ![IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](./documentation/ultimate-configurations.png)

- **IntelliJ IDEA Community:** Use the Maven configurations (Community Edition doesn‚Äôt support Spring Boot configs directly).  
  ![IntelliJ IDEA Community](./documentation/community-configuration.png)

- **Visual Studio Code:**  
  Run the applications via the provided `launch.json` or install the Spring Boot Extension Pack.  
  ![VSCode Configuration](./documentation/vscode-configurations.png)

When running, check these endpoints:
- [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) ‚Äì Flowable Work
- [http://localhost:8091](http://localhost:8091) ‚Äì Flowable Design
- [http://localhost:8092](http://localhost:8092) ‚Äì Flowable Control (optional)
- [http://localhost:8093](http://localhost:8093) ‚Äì Flyable Webportal (optional)

> **Quick Tip:** If Flowable Work and Design are running, you‚Äôre set. Just log in with admin/test and you're good to go.

> **Windows Users:** If you see the "Command line is too long" error (common with IntelliJ IDEA), check the [Common issues](#common-issues) section.

# Optional Additional Information

_(You can skip this section if you‚Äôre in a hurry.)_

## Optional: Custom settings.xml
Many organizations use a custom `settings.xml` file for Maven and may already have the Flowable artifacts in their repository. In that case, you don't need to overwrite the settings or do anything.

If your organization does not (yet) mirror the Flowable artifacts and you prefer not to overwrite your own `settings.xml`, copy your username (e.g. tra-0090-bot) and password into the `settings-flowable.xml` located in the project root.
> **Warning:** Storing passwords in plain text isn‚Äôt recommended. See [Maven's guide on password encryption](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).

Build using:
```sh
mvn -s settings-flowable.xml clean package
```

## Optional: Running Flowable with a Database & Elasticsearch

For a more production-ready setup, use a dedicated Postgres and Elasticsearch setup instead of the default H2 database.

1. **Activate Profiles:**  
   Enable the `postgres` and `elastic` profiles:
   ```sh
   spring.profiles.active=postgres,elastic
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:**  
   The simplest way to set up the necessary services is with Docker:
   ```sh
   cd ./docker/
   docker compose up
   ```

3. **Recreating Containers:**
   - To stop and remove containers:
     ```sh
     cd ./docker
     docker compose down
     ```
   - To remove Docker volumes (data persistence for the database and Elasticsearch), run:
     ```sh
     cd ./docker
     docker compose down -v
     ```
     **WARNING:** This deletes all stored data.

## Common Issues

### Command Line is Too Long (Windows)
If you see the error ‚ÄúCommand line is too long‚Äù in IntelliJ IDEA on Windows, click the **Shorten Command Line** button at the bottom left or update the "Shorten commandline" option in the Spring Boot run configuration.

### npm install Problems
Running `mvn install` may trigger the Flyable Webportal to install frontend dependencies. In most cases, this isn‚Äôt necessary since the project auto-builds on import. Check the optional details if you need to run it manually.
